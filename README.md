# UIDAI Aadhaar Enrolment Data Analysis

##  Problem Statement
Unlocking societal trends in Aadhaar enrolment and updates by identifying
meaningful demographic, regional, and temporal patterns that can support
data-driven decision-making and system improvements in digital identity governance.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview
- Source: UIDAI Aadhaar Enrolment Data (data.gov.in)
- Records Analysed: ~9.7 lakh
- Geography: State, District, Pincode
- Age Groups: 0–4, 5–17, 18+
- Data Type: Enrolments and updates

---

##  Objectives
- Identify age-wise enrolment disparities
- Detect regional and district-level access gaps
- Analyse temporal enrolment behaviour
- Highlight high-demand and under-served regions
- Improve analytical accuracy through data standardization

---

##  Methodology
1. Merged multiple raw UIDAI datasets
2. Performed extensive data cleaning and normalization
3. Standardized state and district names
4. Feature engineering for age ratios and enrolment intensity
5. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
6. Visual exploration of demographic, geographic, and temporal trends
7. Insight synthesis for governance and administrative planning

---

##  Key Insights
- Early-child (0–4) Aadhaar enrolment is uneven across districts, indicating access gaps
- High enrolment clusters correlate with infrastructure availability, not just population
- Predictable monthly enrolment spikes reflect policy and campaign-driven behaviour
- Normalized metrics reveal under-performing districts masked by raw totals
- Data quality and standardization are critical for accurate governance analytics
